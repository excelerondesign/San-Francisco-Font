## How to use it 

Add this `<link/>` element to the head as you would for a normal style sheet:

```css
<link rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/excelerondesign/San-Francisco-Font/sanfrancisco.css"
/>
```

*Feel free to add a preload or other performance enhancement to the `<link/>` element as well.*
